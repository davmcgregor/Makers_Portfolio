## <a name="week1">Week 1 - TDD</a>

### [Pair Programming Project - Boris Bikes](https://github.com/davmcgregor/boris-bikes)

#### Project Details: 

* A program that emulates docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on)
* Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec*

### [Weekend Project - Airport](https://github.com/davmcgregor/airport_challenge)

#### Project Details: 

* This program replicates the flow of traffic at an airport. Planes can land and take off when it is sunny, and no planes can land or take off when it is stormy.
* Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec*

### Skills learnt

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## <a name="week2">Week 2 - OOP</a>

### [Pair Programming Project - Oystercard](https://github.com/davmcgregor/oystercard)

#### Project Details: 
*  Replicate the London metro Oyster Card system including cards, fares, journeys and stations etc. Build on the Object Oriented Programming principles used in week 1 to improve knowledge of Ruby and TDD.
* Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec*

### [Weekend Project - Takeaway](https://github.com/davmcgregor/takeaway-challenge)

#### Project Details: 
* A Takeaway program that allows customers to see a list of dishes and prices, select quantitites, check order totals and receive a confirmation text.
* Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec, Twilio**

### Skills learnt

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## <a name="week3">Week 3 - Web</a>

### [Pair Programming Project - Battle](https://github.com/davmcgregor/Battle)

#### Project Details: 

* A 'Battle' simulator that allows the user to input player names, attack each other and reduce hit points. The game annouces a loser if hit points reach 0.
* Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec, Sinatra, CSS, HTML*

### [Weekend Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/davmcgregor/rps-challenge)

* A 'Battle' simulator that allows user to register their names before playing. Inclues additional 'Lizard' and 'Spock' player moves
* Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec, Sinatra, CSS, HTML*

### Skills learnt

* Build a simple web app
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

## <a name="week4">Week 4 - Ruby Projects - Bookmark Manager & Chitter</a>

### Skills learnt

* Build a simple web app with a database

## <a name="week5">Week 5 - JavaScript Project - Thermostat & Bowling</a>

### Skills learnt

* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language

## <a name="week6">Week 6 - Team Project - MakersBnB </a>

Build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

## <a name="week7">Week 7 - JavaScript Project - Notebook</a>

### Skills learnt

* Build a front-end app in Javascript
* Work competently in Javascript
* Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

## <a name="weeks8/9">Weeks 8 & 9 - Team Engineering Project - Notebook</a>

### Skills learnt

* Work effectively across multiple git branches
* Setup Travis CI and Heroku to deploy code to production
  
## <a name="week10">Week 10 - Tech Tests</a>

### Skills learnt

* Solve challenging technical problems by writing well crafted code
* Demonstrate a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.

## <a name="weeks11/12">Weeks 11 & 12 - Final Project</a>

### Skills learnt

* Develop an app from scratch using agile principles
* Balance the delivery of multiple features against learning new technologies
* Solve problems as a team on a tight timeframe
