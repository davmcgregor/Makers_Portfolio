## <a name="week1">Week 1 - TDD</a>

### [Pair Programming Project - Boris Bikes](https://github.com/davmcgregor/boris-bikes)

#### Project Details: 

- [Boris Bikes (GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/davmcgregor/boris-bikes)
- Outline: A program that emulates docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on)
- Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec*

### [Weekend Project -Airport(https://github.com/davmcgregor/airport_challenge)

#### Project Details: 

- [Airport (GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/davmcgregor/airport_challenge)
- Outline: This program replicates the flow of traffic at an airport. Planes can land and take off when it is sunny, and no planes can land or take off when it is stormy.
- Technologies Used: *Ruby, RSpec*

### Skills learnt

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Skills learnt

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
